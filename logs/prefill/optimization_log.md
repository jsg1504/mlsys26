## 2026-04-07 Iteration 1

- Idea: cache the per-timestep decayed shared state `temp = g * state` in `s_state` during the k-dot pass, then reuse it in the update pass.
- Why: the baseline recomputed `g * s_state[...]` for every `(vi, tid)` during the second loop even though the decayed value had already been produced in the first loop.
- Result: quick Modal benchmark passed all 100 workloads with `mean_speedup 6.42` versus the comparable logged baseline `6.37`.
- Decision: commit.
